Hello! Welcome to my personal academic website. My name is Jae Hong and I am a neuroscientist/physician in training. My research interests include MRI, neuroimaging, aging, lifespan, and development, as well as neurodegenerative disorders. My clinical interests include working with a variety of neurodegenerative conditions across modalities. If any of this sounds interesting to you, feel free to get in touch and I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions!

What I Do
======
Currently I am a medical student at the European University Cyprus - Frankfurt Branch. I am building clinical experience so that I can work further with patients and contribute to healthcare directly. Though I am at the start of my journey, I believe that I have built a strong foundation to fully take advantage of my time here.

What I Did
======
Before pursuing medicine, I wore many different hats. I previously completed a bachelor's at Dartmouth College, where I was a research assistant for Ida Gobbini, and we investigated the effects of implicit bias on facial perception. Afterwards, I took a few detours which included working on a ranch in Colorado, teaching German kindergartners English, and serving as a techinical recruiter for Amazon Alexa. Ultimately, I decided my heart (and brain!) was back in academia, so I pursued a master's in neuroscience at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I gained an immense amount of experience and worked as a research assistant/wrote my thesis under the supervision of Maryam Ziaei, where I got my first taste of MRI and neuroimaging. Throughout my time in Norway, I realized I wanted to work more along the lines of a clinician-scientist to bring research advances into the clinic. This is the journey that brought me to today and what an exciting journey it was.

My Background
======
Ethnically Korean, citizen of the world, the question "Where are you from?" always gets a long answer from me. I currently speak 6 languages and you can often find me visiting the smallest alleys in a new city.
